# CSCI24000_spring23_final_project

This is my final project for CSCI24000 at IUPUI. It is a command line version of Wheel of Fortune, but with no pop-up rounds, no bonus round, and no all-inclusive vacations.
Features also include the ability to save and quit, which saves the game and all of the information within.

Potential puzzle answers were taken from wheeloffortuneanswer.com
